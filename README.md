# imdb_sentiment_analysis_NBayes_vs_RNN

Google Colab was used to write the code to make use of its GPU computing feature.

Results:
| Method    | MnNB      | Single Layer RNN | Multi-Layer RNN |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy  | 82%       | 85%              | 85%             |

Next step is build a model using Transformer encoder pre-trained model BERT
